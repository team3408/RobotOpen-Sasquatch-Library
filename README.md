RobotOpen-Sasquatch-Library
===========================

Arduino Library for Sasquatch Robot Controller

This library was forked for the sole purpose of creating a extra version of the ROEncoder library file and to have that action be documented.
We need a new version of that file as we intend to use 8 encoders on our swerve drive where the logic is being done on a 
sasquatch robot controller.
That is all.
